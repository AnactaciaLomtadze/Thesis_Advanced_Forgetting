## Overview

This thesis investigates whether **cognitive forgetting mechanisms** can improve knowledge graph-based recommendation systems. **Spoiler**: They don't work in sparse data environments.

### Key Finding
**Forgetting mechanisms cause 79.2% performance loss** for only 5-15% memory savings in sparse datasets.

## Results Summary

| Method | Hit Rate@10 | Status |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Quality-Based (Baseline)** | **12.0%** | ‚úÖ Best |
| Popularity-Based | 9.0% | ‚úÖ Good |
| Neural Adaptive Forgetting | 2.0% | ‚ùå -83% |
| Attention-Based Forgetting | 2.0% | ‚ùå -83% |
| Cascade Forgetting | 1.0% | ‚ùå -92% |
| Contextual Forgetting | 1.0% | ‚ùå -92% |

## Quick Start

### 1. Installation
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn networkx scikit-learn tqdm kagglehub[pandas-datasets]
```

### 2. Run Evaluation
```bash
# Load dataset and run complete evaluation
python thesis_final_evaluation.py

# Test individual mechanisms
python test_fixed_mechanisms.py
```

### 3. Dataset Loading
```python
import kagglehub
from kagglehub import KaggleDatasetAdapter

# Load Amazon reviews dataset
df = kagglehub.load_dataset(
    KaggleDatasetAdapter.PANDAS,
    "saurav9786/amazon-product-reviews",
    ""
)
```

- `amazon_knowledge_graph.py` - Knowledge graph implementation

## üîç Key Insights

### What We Learned
- **Sparse data breaks forgetting**: Each interaction is too valuable to remove
- **Cognitive models ‚â† Recommender systems**: Human memory principles don't translate directly
- **Negative results matter**: Important scientific contribution showing what doesn't work

### Why Forgetting Failed
1. **Data sparsity**: Only 0.3% of user-item pairs observed
2. **No redundancy**: Removing any edge breaks recommendation paths
3. **Cold-start amplification**: Forgetting makes sparse data even sparser

## Mechanisms Tested

| Mechanism | Inspiration | Key Insight |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Neural Adaptive** | Synaptic plasticity | Can't learn from sparse data |
| **Attention-Based** | Selective attention | Removes meaningful connections |
| **Cascade Forgetting** | Spreading activation | Over-aggressive propagation |
| **Contextual Forgetting** | Context-dependent memory | Weak contextual signals |

- **Scale**: 147,412 ratings, 4,883 users, 9,956 products
- **Sparsity**: 97% (extremely sparse)
- **Domain**: Electronics category

## Scientific Contribution

**This is the first systematic study showing that cognitive forgetting mechanisms are harmful in sparse recommendation environments.**

### Research Impact
- Establishes clear boundaries for forgetting in recommender systems
- Provides evaluation framework for memory-aware systems
- Prevents future researchers from pursuing ineffective approaches
- Quantifies the memory-performance trade-off

## Future Directions

- **Sparsity-aware forgetting**: Only forget when data density allows
- **Hybrid approaches**: Balance retention and forgetting
- **Dense dataset validation**: Test on MovieLens, Last.fm
- **Conditional mechanisms**: Adapt forgetting to user profiles

## Key Takeaway

**Don't apply cognitive forgetting mechanisms to sparse recommendation data.** This research shows they cause significant performance degradation without meaningful benefits.
